public keys for coop devops

to addus to your server:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebHostingCoopTeam/keys/master/addus.sh | bash
```

or use sudo:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebHostingCoopTeam/keys/master/addus.sh | sudo bash
```

but if you’re not a part of the coop then what are you doing this for?

okay to make the key making part easier I made a docker image that does nothing but make the gitreceive key for you:
